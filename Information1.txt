Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the interaction between computers and human (natural) languages. The goal of NLP is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both meaningful and useful.

Key Components of NLP:
Text Processing:
 (1) Tokenization
 (2) Lemmatization and Stemming
 (3) POS Tagging
Text Understanding:
 (1) Syntax Analysis (Parsing)
 (2) Semantic Analysis
 (3) Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Text Generation:
 (1) Generating human-like responses or content, such as in chatbots or translation systems.

Common Applications:
 (1) Chatbots: Automated systems that can converse with users
 (2) Machine Translation: Tools like Google Translate
 (3) Sentiment Analysis: Determining the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of a text
 (4) Speech Recognition: Converting spoken language into text, used in virtual assistants like Siri or Google Assistant.

Tokenization: Breaking down text into smaller units like words or sentences.

Lemmatization and Stemming: Reducing words to their base or root form.

POS Tagging: Labeling words with their grammatical roles (e.g., noun, verb).

Syntax Analysis (Parsing): Understanding the structure of a sentence.

Semantic Analysis: Understanding the meaning behind words and sentences.

Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying proper names, dates, organizations, etc.
